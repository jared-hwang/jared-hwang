            IsoDAR (Isotope Decay at Rest Experiment), Prof. Janet Conrad, MIT <br> 2018 - 2020
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            IsoDAR is designed to perform searches for sterile neutrino oscillations and non-standard neutrino interactions. 
            It does so by accelerating dihydrogen molecules through a <b>radio frequency quadruple (RFQ)</b>, then a cyclotron, which
            then impinge onto a beryllium and lithium target, ultimately producing a large amount of antineutrinos which can be
            studied. More information about the experiment can be found <a href="https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/daedalus/">here</a>, or
            in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5081">this paper</a>.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            My role in this experiment was to produce an end-to-end simulation package for the RFQ that could:
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
                <li>Be modular with previous experiment simulation packages.</li>
                <li>Accurately simulate a customizable RFQ factoring in space-charge (charged particles interacting with other particles), which other RFQ simulators could not.</li>
                <li>Be easily instantiated, customized, and fit in with existing simulations.</li>
                <li>Be able to be parallelized, and have fast performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            This involved individually designing and testing the various components of the RFQ mostly from scratch, and then incorporating them
            into the larger simulation framework. Ultimately, all of the above were achieved, producing an RFQ package, using the WARP particle-in-cell 
            framework, that could easily be used, was more accurate, flexible, and at least as fast (if not faster) than preexisting software.

            I also implemented built-in diagnostic tools (after realizing that a simulation without interpretable data output wasn't the most helpful), which 
            allowed the user to examine beam quality and other features (emittance, electric field, etc.) during, and after the simulation, as well as automatic
            bunch-detection to analyze the properties of a single bunch. 
            
            <br><br>
            In addition, I explored different methods to speed-up the simulation, between different parallelization slicing and adaptive meshing techniques, to mixed results.
