            IsoDAR (Isotope Decay at Rest Experiment), Prof. Janet Conrad, MIT <br> 2018 - 2020
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            IsoDAR is designed to perform searches for sterile neutrino oscillations and non-standard neutrino interactions. 
            It does so by accelerating dihydrogen molecules through a <b>radio frequency quadruple (RFQ)</b>, then a <b>cyclotron</b>, which
            then impinge onto a beryllium and lithium target, ultimately producing a large amount of antineutrinos which can be
            studied. More information about the experiment can be found <a href="https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/daedalus/">here</a>, or
            in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5081">this paper</a>.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            My role in this experiment was to produce an end-to-end simulation package for the RFQ that could:
            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
                <li>Be modular with previous experiment simulation packages.</li>
                <li>Accurately simulate a customizable RFQ factoring in space-charge, which other RFQ simulators could not.</li>
                <li>Be easily instantiated, customized, and fit in with existing simulations.</li>
                <li>Be able to be parallelized, and have fast performance.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; width: 60%;">
            All of the above were achieved, producing an RFQ package using the WARP particle-in-cell framework that could easily be used
            and was ~2x faster, and more accurate than preexisting software. I also included built-in diagnostic tools from scratch, which
            allowed the user to examine beam quality and other features during, and after the simulation. A paper about the RFQ can be read 
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07258">here</a>, and the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/DanielWinklehner/py_rfq_helper">here</a>.
