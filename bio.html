		<h1>Jared's Bio</h1>
		<p>	My name is Jared, and I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University, double majoring in Physics and Computer Science. I was born in New Jersey, and attended half of elementary school there, before my family moved to Shanghai. I spent the next ten years in Shanghai, attending Shanghai American School for middle and high school.</p>
		<p>	Other than Physics and Computer Science, I enjoy listening to music (Jazz and Classic Rock are my favorites), playing music (Trumpet and Piano), and doing origami. </p>
		<p>English is my native language, and I also speak Mandarin Chinese at a conversational level. I am also currently studying Japanese at an elementary level. </p>
